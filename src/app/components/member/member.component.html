        <p class="description-text">
          The principle of Free Open Source Software, as we now know it, started
          with Richard Stallman’s development of the concept of “free software”
          in the early 1980s. To further his vision, not to mention some pretty
          good software, Richard went on to build the GNU project and the Free
          Software Foundation. It took some more decades, but it became apparent
          to most people at the beginning of the 2000s that the vision of free
          software was consolidating the share of minds around the world.
