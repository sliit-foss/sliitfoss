    <h2 class="mt-3">Purpose of Code of Conduct</h2>

    <p>
      The purpose of our Community Code of Conduct is to ensure that all
      participants in the SLIIT FOSS community have the best possible
      experience. We are all here to help each other learn, grow our skillsets,
      and have a good time! The SLIIT FOSS Community Code of Conduct covers our
      behavior as members of the SLIIT FOSS community, in any forum, mailing
      list, wiki, web site, code repository, IRC channel, private
      correspondence, or public meetings. As a worldwide community, diversity is
      one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues
      and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask
      people to adhere to, to ensure that the SLIIT FOSS community continues to
      be an excellent space in which like-minded individuals are able to
      communicate, collaborate, and contribute. This isn't an exhaustive list of
      things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's
      intended — a guide to make it easier to be excellent to one another. We
      expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.
      <i>
        If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you
        report it by emailing infosliitfoss@gmail.com.
